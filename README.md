# MO2 Download Manager+

![preview](./docs/window.png)

## What It Does

Adds a few new features to manage downloads within MO2 for hoarders like me.
Features include:

- Batch installation of mods
- Batch deletion of downloads
    - Custom auto-selection of duplicates, keeping the latest of each downloaded mod but removing old versions
- Batch removal of mods from the download list within MO2
- TBD...........

## Installing

Download the zip archive here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/aglowinthefield/mo2-download-manager/releases/) (I wrote this README for Nexus haha)

Extract into the root of your MO2 install.

## Using

![launch](./docs/launch.png)

Click the plugins icon in the MO2 toolbar and launch with Download Manager.

**NOTE** Because 'refresh' is possibly pretty expensive if you have 100s
of GBs of downloads, it does not run on launch by default.
Hit refresh once when the window opens :)

## Feedback

Hit me up on GitHub or Nexus for issues. I'm an experienced dev
but unfortunately not with PyQt or C++, so any suggestions are
more than welcome. I made this for my own sanity and hope it's
useful for you too. Part of an upcoming suite of MO2 plugins and
improvements once I get my sea-legs with C++ and CMake.
